    As a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/">Microsoft Research AI Resident</a>, developed a state-of-the-art deep neural-net conversational agent model in Pytorch. The <a href="https://github.com/HomeroRR/rmm">code</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00728">final draft</a> are now publicly available. I also co-authored <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-dualscreen">TwoPaneView for React Native</a> which enables the dynamic rendering of Views on dual screen devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo.
