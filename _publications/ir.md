    <p>In this project, we explore structural properties of the alliance, war, and sentiment graphs of the the Correlates of War dataset, including the roles of individual nodes, structural motifs, and graph-level communities. In contrast to most previous work, we also explicitly analyze changes to the graphs over time.</p>
