    I co-authored <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-dualscreen">TwoPaneView for React Native</a> which enables the dynamic rendering of Views on dual screen devices like the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo">Microsoft Surface Duo</a>. The GitHub repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-dualscreen"> Link</a> and the npm package can be found at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-twopaneview"> Link</a>
