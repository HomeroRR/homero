    NavLead is a type of virtual assistant that specializes in giving directions. Technically speaking, NavLead is a machine learning model trained to generate text answers. In the demo website, we showcase the power of NavLead through a live demo in a 3D environment developed in Unity and Blender. In this demo, users can ask questions through a chat interface as they navigate a 3D house looking for a target. Upon receiving a question, NavLead infers an answer in text at the server and sends the response to the user. Under the hood, NavLead employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture that takes as input the sequence of words in the playerâ€™s question along with the location of the player for context and outputs a sequence of generated words as a text answer.
